Final project of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about)'s Foundations course.

# Dev Notes
- add if loops in the selecting operator and typing second number
    - if there is no initalNum, then the number entered becomes the initialNum
    - if there is no initialNum, clicking the operator doesn't do anything
    - if there is an initialNum && operatorSelect, then the number entered becomes secondNum
    - the Num functions might need to just be combined.
